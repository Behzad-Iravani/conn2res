conn2res
=========

The ``conn2res`` is a reservoir computing toolbox designed 
for neuroscientes to simulate connectome-informed reservoirs.

The main advantage offered by this toolbox is its flexibility in 
terms of the connectivity matrix used for the reservoir, the local dynamics 
of the nodes, the possibility to select the set of input and output nodes, and 
a diversity of neuroscience tasks provided by NeuroGym (https://github.com/neurogym/neurogym).


A short primer on Reservoir Computing 
-------------------------------------

Reservoir computing is a computational paradigm that uses artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract information from a continuous stream of external stimuli and approximate complex time-varying functions (Lukoševičius, M. and Jaeger, H, 2009).
